The separate models made from the data provided by NCPOR center Goa, are named as RNN and LSTM model- paper respectively. 

The Blizzard_django folder contains the project that was built to see the number of blizzards occuring in a user inputed month. The prediction model inferences can also be seen via the user via the website built for the user.
